# Data structures and algorithms in Go

Teaching myself some Go while refreshing data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures

* [Hash table](pkg/ds/hash_table.go) with linear probing for collision resolution
* [Singly linked list](pkg/ds/singly_linked_list.go) with head and tail pointers
  * [Stack](pkg/ds/stack.go)
  * [Queue](pkg/ds/queue.go)
